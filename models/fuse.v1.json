  "description": "Input schema for fuse objects for PowerModelsProtection\n\nThis has a single property not included in OpenDSS which describes the minimum melting curve of the fuse. The minimum melting curve describes the load current which a fuse must stay below in order to guarantee that the load current will not cause the fuse to melt. This is the field minimum\\_melting\\_curve which is a string referring to an OpenDSS TCC object. An Example of a TCC object is below, which provides the number of points, current values associated with each point, and time value associated with each point.\n\nNew \"Fuse.f2\" MonitoredObj=Transformer.Tg MonitoredTerm=1 FuseCurve=Tlink RatedCurrent=65\nNew \"TCC\\_Curve.tlink\" npts=7 C\\_array=(2, 2.1, 3, 4, 6, 22, 50, ) T\\_array=(300, 100, 10.1, 4, 1.4, 0.1, 0.02, )",
